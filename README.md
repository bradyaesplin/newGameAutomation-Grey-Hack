(Early Access) Game mimics a Unix enviroment, can be played Player vs. Enviroment or Player vs. Player. In the first part of a new game, the player must hack the WiFi signals that can be detected by their computer in order to gain access to the internet and thus the main part of the game. 

The games scripting language is called GreyScript and is similar to Lua (and Javascript), and powered by MiniScript. Documentation can be found [here](https://codedocs.ghtools.xyz/).

This script was written in the in-game editor, you can just copy and paste the code into the in-game editor.exe and save it.
